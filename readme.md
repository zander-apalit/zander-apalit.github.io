# HOW TO HOST A RESUME USING JEKYLL
### PURPOSE
The purpose of this readme page is to demonstrate hosting a resume using Github Pages.
### PREREQUISITES
This process will require two things:
1. A resume written in Markdown. A guide to Markdown can be found in [More Resources](https://github.com/zander-apalit/zander-apalit.github.io/blob/master/readme.md#more-resources)
2. A Github account. [Create an account here if you don't have one.](https://github.com/)
