# HOW TO HOST A RESUME USING JEKYLL
---
### PURPOSE
The purpose of this readme page is to demonstrate hosting a resume using Github Pages. This process will make us of Jekyll to host the website, but it won't require any knowledge of Jekyll to complete. All of the editing can be done either through your Markdown editor or through Github Pages.

### PREREQUISITES
This process will require two things:
1. A resume formatted in Markdown. A guide to Markdown can be found in [More Resources](https://github.com/zander-apalit/zander-apalit.github.io/blob/master/readme.md#more-resources)
2. A Github account. [Create an account here if you don't have one.](https://github.com/)

### FAQ

##### Why should I host my resume on a static website?
As described in Etter's _Modern Technical Writing_, hosting your content on a static website has many advantages in distribution. Any time the content is updated, the changes are immediately available to anyone accessing the website. If you were distributing your files by email, for example, there would be outdated versions of your content floating around, and everytime you updated the content, you would have to redistribute it to every relevant person in a very inefficient process. Static websites ensure there is always one definitive and up-to-date version of your content that is widely accessible.

##### Why is my resume not showing up?
